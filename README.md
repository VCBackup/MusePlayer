# MusePlayer

## Purpose

Since Google Play Music is no longer supported, we are creating an mp3 player where a user can add mp3 tracks that he/she owns into Amazon S3 and play them. We do not like the idea of YouTube Music and endlessly pushing people into paid subscriptions for content they already own.

## End-State

We envision an application that can play user-owned mp3s that are stored in the cloud on multiple devices running either in the foreground or background.
